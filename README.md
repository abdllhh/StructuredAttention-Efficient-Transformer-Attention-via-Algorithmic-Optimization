# StructuredAttention-Efficient-Transformer-Attention-via-Algorithmic-Optimization
Trying to accelerate transformer attention mechanisms through advanced data structures (KD-trees and segment trees), reducing the quadratic complexity of traditional attention to enable faster inference and longer sequence processing
