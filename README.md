# StructuredAttention-Efficient-Transformer-Attention-via-Algorithmic-Optimization
Trying to accelerate transformer attention mechanisms through advanced data structures (KD-trees and segment trees), reducing the quadratic complexity of traditional attention to enable faster inference and longer sequence processing

## How Attention Mechanism Works Normally
Standard self-attention operates as follows:

1. Input preparation: You have three matrices derived from the input:

- Queries (Q): What you're looking for
- Keys (K): What you're comparing against
- Values (V): What you're retrieving/aggregating

2. Similarity calculation: For each query and every key, compute their similarity:
 S = Q × K^T
 This matrix multiplication has O(n²) complexity.

3. Scaling: Scale the similarity scores to stabilize gradients:
 S_scaled = S / sqrt(d_k)
 where d_k is the dimension of the key vectors.

4. Softmax normalization: Apply softmax row-wise to get attention weights:
 A = softmax(S_scaled)

5. Weighted aggregation: Combine values based on attention weights:
 Output = A × V

This approach is computationally expensive primarily because steps 2 and 4 involve operations across all pairs of positions in the sequence.

## The innovations in this project are:

### KD-Tree for approximate similarity search:

- Instead of comparing each query with all keys (O(n²)), use a KD-tree to find the most similar keys in O(log n) time
- This approximates the full attention but dramatically reduces computation for long sequences
- Only compute attention weights for the most relevant keys (top-k selection)


### Sparse attention patterns implementation:

- Traditional attention computes dense attention weights
- This implementation tries to create sparse attention matrices
- Focus computational resources only on the most important connections

## Implementation Details
### Core Components

- Matrix Class: Efficient matrix operations implementation supporting attention computations
- KD-Tree: Space-partitioning data structure for quick nearest-neighbor searches
- BaseAttention: Standard attention implementation (O(n²) complexity)
- KDAttention: Optimized implementation using KD-Tree (O(n·log(n)) complexity)

### Optimization Explained
Standard attention requires each query to interact with every key:
```// For each query
for (size_t i = 0; i < seq_len; ++i) {
    // Compare with ALL keys (O(n²) complexity)
    for (size_t j = 0; j < seq_len; ++j) {
        // Compute similarity, apply to output
    }
}
```
Our optimized version uses KD-Trees to find only relevant keys:
```// For each query
for (size_t i = 0; i < seq_len; ++i) {
    // Find only top-K most similar keys (O(log(n)) per query)
    std::vector<int> nearest = kdtree.findKNearest(query, topK_);
    
    // Process only these K keys (not all n keys)
    for (size_t j = 0; j < nearest.size(); ++j) {
        // Compute similarity, apply to output
    }
}
```
### For Example (Theoretical)
Consider a sequence from a language model processing the text: "The architecture of ancient Rome was..."
With standard attention:
Each word attends to all other words (100 words = 10,000 comparisons)
Most of these comparisons produce negligible attention weights
Yet we compute all of them, wasting resources

With KD-Tree attention:
The word "architecture" quickly finds related words: "Rome", "ancient"
It ignores largely irrelevant words like "the", "was", etc.
The model focuses computation only on meaningful relationships

## Practical Applications
This optimization enables:

- Processing longer sequences with the same computational resources
- Reduced inference latency for transformer models
- Lower power consumption for transformer applications
- Improved throughput for processing large batches of text

### Key Findings

- Increasing Speedup: The performance advantage grows with sequence length
- Minimal Accuracy Loss: Approximation error remains below 0.002 across all tests
- Quadratic vs Near-Linear: The standard attention shows clear quadratic growth, while the optimized version grows much more slowly (as visible in the graph)
